# VueMart

Just a basic vue app, adding vuex in the near future to flesh out the app.

- Currently using vue router for navigation.

- Using [keikaavousi/fake-store-api](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api "Fake Store API GitHub Repo") for mock product catalogue.

(see other branch for an early vue 3 version of the project)
